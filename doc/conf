The file "janus.conf" is the configuration file for janus. It is a line-based
file divided into sections for linked networks.

	Enables or disables IPv6 support. This value is only read once, at the startup of janus.

set::janus nick
	Sets the default nick for the janus interface bot

set::pass password
	Sets the rehash password so that "/msg janus rehash password" will work as
	a non-oper

set::diepass password
	Sets the password to use "/msg janus die" and "/msg janus restart"; if this
	is left out those commands are disabled
