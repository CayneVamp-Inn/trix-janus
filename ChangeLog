Trix-janus 1.10
===============

A Change Log without the white noise:
-------------------------------------
* Fixed the InspIRCd modules so they support +a and +q channel modes by default.
* Made the Bot Interface use PRIVMSG instead of NOTICE.
* Simpified the Global Module so it uses PRIVMSG by default and added some colour to it.
* Made the up-tar command use my github repository and it removes the tgz file it downloads after it upgrades the files.
* Fixed the bug where Janus was sending a message to Denora everytime VERSION was run.
* Fixed the verify bug which was checking something nonsensical (why check for channels that were not linked?).
* Standardized parts of the ClientBot module to be more like an IRC client.
* Added +a and +q channel modes support to ClientBot
* Integrated ircreview's tagall function (setable from the conf), but less aggressively while excluding the Janus bot from being tagged.
* Made the oper visibility (oper sharing lvl) setting configurable from the conf file and integrated it so it would work. UnrealIRCd still doesn't play nice with it though... :/
* Added more configuration options for the Janus controller bot - now you can set EVERYTHING about it ;)
* Added ircreview's SporkIRCd module and modified it to work with the default Janus.
* Fixed the bug I caused with Unreal.pm earlier - chan ops sharing works like expected now ;)
* Updated the README and janus.conf.example to mention and include the above changes.
* Upped InterJanus' Clock desync allowed from 20 or less to 75 or less.
* Made the ForceTag command remove tags from a user when TagAll is enabled.
* Commented out an annoying (and common) error about locally done UID or nicks.
* Fixed a minor bug with the ForceTag reversal code when TagAll is enabled.
* Disabled a few Protocol based error message (they have nothing to do with Janus anyway...)
* Fixed issue in ClientBot.pm with mode changes on non-existant networks (thanks to avenj since my code failed...)
* Disabled the global notice sent by ClientBot.pm to all channel ops complaining that it doesn't have ops!
