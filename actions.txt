Special fields:
	sendto: an arrayref identifying the list of networks to send to
		specify this only when creating the action
		Exception: LINK and DELINK, as they do the list merging needed
	nojlink: do not send to remote janus networks
		used i.e. for QUITs from a NETSPLIT, where the NETSPLIT itself is sent
		across the jlink, so sending the QUITs too would be a waste of bandwidth

type: src -> dst

dst must be Nick or Channel. Can be undef if {sendto} is specified.
src must be either a Nick, Network, or undef

CONNECT: * -> Nick
	net - Network

QUIT: * -> Nick
	msg - quit message (already prefixed with Quit: if needed)
	killer - Nick that did a local kill on the dst nick
		(in this case, msg is "Killed ($msg)")

KILL: * -> Nick
	msg - kill message
	net - network to remove the nick from
	this is ONLY for cross-janus kills as it is translated to a series 
		of KICK actions in a parse hook

NICK: * -> Nick
	nick - new base nick
	After the act hook in Nick, all local networks have members in hashes:
	from{$id} - source nick for network $id
	to{$id} - destination nick for network $id

NICKINFO: * -> Nick
	item - one of 'host ident name swhois'
	value - string to set

UMODE: * -> Nick
	value - mode change string

JOIN: Nick -> Channel
	mode - hash of n_ channel modes to apply during the join

PART: Nick -> Channel
	msg - part message

KICK: * -> Channel
	kickee - Nick
	reason - reason

MODE: * -> Channel
	mode - array representing +/- items
		Ex: qw/-invite +key +op -voice/
	args - array of arguments (either strings or Nicks)
		Ex: ['secret', Nick::me, Nick::annoying]

TOPIC: * -> Channel
	topic - topic
	topicts - set timestamp of topic
	topicset - STRING of topic setter

MSG: [Nick, undef] -> *
	msg - message
	notice - 1 if this is a NOTICE, 0 if PRIVMSG
	prefix - if exists, is one of '~&@%+' for @#channel messages

LINKREQ: * -> Network
	chan - Channel object being offered (for inter-janus channel sync)
	net - source network
	slink - channel name on source network
	dlink - channel name on dest network

LSYNC: * -> Network
	Note: this action makes no sense until you look at InterJanus
	linkto - the NAME of the channel to link, on the dest network
	chan - the other channel to link

LINK: * -> Channel
	chan1, chan2 - channels to merge into the destination

DELINK: * -> Channel
	net - Network to drop
	split - split off channel (only exists after the act stage)

NETLINK:
	net - new network

NETSPLIT:
	net - gone network
