See the example configuration for a description of what is needed there.

Start janus using the command line: perl -T janus.pl


Available modules:

Modules::Ban
  Allows per-network bans of specific expressions matching users. Causes an
  auto-kickban when the user joins a remote channel.

Modules::BanSet
  Faster ban implementation for large ban lists (hundreds)

Modules::Claim
  Prevents opers and other network's services from changing modes in a shared
  channel if that channel has been claimed to certain home network(s)

Modules::Services
  Prevents communcation to and from remote services, and prevents services kills
  from being translated into kicks unless they are repeated.

Modules::Signals
  Rehashes the janus server on reciept of a SIGHUP.

Modules::Spamfilter (EXPERIMENTAL)
  Kills users sending a message matching a hardcoded regular expression

Modules::Vanish
  Similar to ban, but makes the user invisible to the banning network rather
  than kicking them.

Modules::WhoisFilter
  Filters the /whois notification sent for remote nicks.
